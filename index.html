        <br />
        <p>
          Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, the youngest of
          three children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA
          player Joe Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John
          "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe,
          Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was
          derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was
          Catholic and he was brought up with this faith. Bryant started playing
          basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his favorite team
          when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from
          the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing
          professional basketball.

          Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California,
          scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders
          struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and
          Lakers coach Del Harris. He scored 36 points in the finale and
          finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games.
          As a rookie in 1996â€“97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards
          Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time, he was the second-youngest
          player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days) and also became
          the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant
          played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see
          some more playing time.

          <h1>The Birth of Black Mamba</h1>

          <p>
            Every Kobe fan knows his alter ego is "Black Mamba." But, the moniker's roots have a deep emotional and intellectual significance in Bryant's life. He explains in "Kobe Bryant's Muse" that in 2003 he was being heavily ridiculed by the crowd and felt like his life was spiraling out of control. So, he created the Black Mamba to detach from that reality.

            "Kobe has to deal with these issues, all the personal challenges. The Black Mamba steps on the court and does what he does...I'm destroying everybody that stepped on the court," he explained.

          <h1>A Historic 81-Point Game</h1>

          <p>On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant led the Lakers to a 122-104 victory over the Toronto Raptors. Bryant dominated the court that night, scoring 81 points in the game. At the time, it was the second-highest scoring game in NBA history.</p>

            It's no secret Bryant gained many accolades during his years in the league. He may not have cared as much about being the most valuable player as he did winning championships, but that didn't stop him from earning the title multiple times. Overall, he was named the NBA All-Star MVP four times, the NBA Finals MVP twice, and the overall NBA MVP once.
